# WatchOver: AI-Powered Emergency Training Platform

## Problem Statement
The lack of effective training tools for emergency dispatchers and responders often leads to delayed response times and suboptimal decisions during critical situations. This gap is particularly significant in addressing challenges such as scalable dispatcher training, enhancing real-time decision-making, and improving collaboration between emergency teams. These issues align with the Laerdal challenges of creating life-saving solutions through technology.

## Solution: WatchOver
**WatchOver** addresses these challenges by providing:
- AI-driven simulations for realistic dispatcher training.
- A grading and feedback system to evaluate decision-making skills.
- A seamless integration of first responders into emergencies using real-time communication.

The platform is designed to empower dispatchers and responders with tools to make quicker, more accurate decisions, ultimately improving outcomes in emergency situations.
